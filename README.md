# SICXE-Complier-in-Java

This was a project for my Language processors class. It takes simple arithmetic arguments and turns them into SICXE commands. 
Data .txt is an example of the arguments that can be compiled. Data.asm is the SICXE output.

The output is modified SICXE Code to make it more similar to the Assembly language register convention. It will not actually run as SICXE is a theoretical language more than an actual usable one. Read more about it on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIC/XE
